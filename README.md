## Truth Table Generator

Truth Table Generator is a simple web app to help users make truth tables quickly and easily. It supports the functions AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. Other functions such as XOR can be implemented indirectly. It also updates the table dynamically as you type, so you don't have to waste time clicking a submit button. It is intended for people building simple circuits with logic gates, to check to make sure their circuit will work the way they expect.
